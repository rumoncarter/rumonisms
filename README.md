# rumonisms
A glossary of weird (to some, though totally normal to me - therein lies the mischief!) words and phrases that come out of my mouth and keyboard. Established in an attempt to help others to better understand me and my oddities, as part of <a href="https://github.com/rumoncarter/rumon-readme/blob/main/README.md">a broader exercise to openly share information on how I work, and how to work with me</a>. :-)
